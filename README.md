## Current System Strengths & Limitations
## **System Analysis: AI-Powered Financial Dashboard**

### **‚úÖ Strengths**  
- **Core Financial Tracking**: Robust handling of Balance Sheets, P&L statements, and historical trends.  
- **Basic AI Integration**:  
  - GPT-3.5 generates financial tips.  
  - Simple anomaly detection for revenue/expense spikes.  
- **Structured Data**: Assets, liabilities, and equity components are well-organized for analysis.

### **üîç Limitations & Future Improvements**  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Current growth projections (5%) lack:  
  - Confidence intervals or scenario modeling.  
  - Driver analysis (e.g., "Marketing spend drives 70% of revenue growth").  
- **Anomaly Detection**:  
  - Reactive (flags spikes post-occurrence).  
  - **Goal**: Real-time alerts with root-cause explanations (e.g., "Duplicate vendor payments detected").  
- **AI Contextualization**:  
  - GPT-3.5 tips are generic.  
  - **Planned Upgrade**: Fine-tune GPT-4 on our financial data for actionable insights.
 
    
## ‚úÖ What Works Well:
* Core Financial Tracking: Solid foundation in Balance Sheet, P&L, and historical trend analysis.
* Basic AI Integration: GPT-3.5 for tips and simple anomaly detection adds preliminary value.
* Data Availability: Key financial data points (assets, liabilities, revenue/expenses) are already structured.

## üîç Key Limitations:
* Shallow Predictive Power: 5% growth projection is too generic (no confidence intervals, drivers, or scenario modeling).
* Reactive Anomaly Detection: Only flags spikes post-occurrence (no root-cause analysis or prevention).
* Underutilized Data: Historical trends aren‚Äôt leveraged for forecasting or optimization.
* GPT-3.5‚Äôs Generic Outputs: Financial tips lack contextual relevance to your specific data.
