## Current System Strengths & Limitations
‚úÖ What Works Well:
* Core Financial Tracking: Solid foundation in Balance Sheet, P&L, and historical trend analysis.
* Basic AI Integration: GPT-3.5 for tips and simple anomaly detection adds preliminary value.
* Data Availability: Key financial data points (assets, liabilities, revenue/expenses) are already structured.

## üîç Key Limitations:
* Shallow Predictive Power: 5% growth projection is too generic (no confidence intervals, drivers, or scenario modeling).
* Reactive Anomaly Detection: Only flags spikes post-occurrence (no root-cause analysis or prevention).
* Underutilized Data: Historical trends aren‚Äôt leveraged for forecasting or optimization.
* GPT-3.5‚Äôs Generic Outputs: Financial tips lack contextual relevance to your specific data.
