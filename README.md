## Current System Strengths & Limitations
## **System Analysis: AI-Powered Financial Dashboard**

### **‚úÖ Strengths (What works well)**  
- **Core Financial Tracking**: Robust handling of Balance Sheets, P&L statements, and historical trends.  
- **Basic AI Integration**:  
  - GPT-3.5 generates financial tips.  
  - Simple anomaly detection for revenue/expense spikes.  
- **Structured Data**: Assets, liabilities, and equity components are well-organized for analysis.

### **üîç Limitations & Future Improvements (Not yet implemented)**  
- **Predictive Analytics**: Current growth projections (5%) lack:  
  - Confidence intervals or scenario modeling.  
  - Driver analysis (e.g., "Marketing spend drives 70% of revenue growth").  
- **Anomaly Detection**:  
  - Reactive (flags spikes post-occurrence).  
  - **Goal**: Real-time alerts with root-cause explanations (e.g., "Duplicate vendor payments detected").  
- **AI Contextualization**:  
  - GPT-3.5 tips are generic.  
  - **Planned Upgrade**: Fine-tune GPT-4 on our financial data for actionable insights.
